I'm Victoria, a senior studying economics, statistics, and political science at Stanford University. I supported economics research at the Brookings Institution, Innovations for Poverty Action, and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.<br>

I enjoy reading creative non-fiction essays. My current favorites are [Goodbye to All That](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/22211308/joan-didion-goodbye-to-all-that-1.pdf), [Notes of a Native Son](https://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/570f15/baldwin.pdf), and [The Courage of Turtles](https://dayonecomptwo.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hoagland-the-courage-of-turtles.pdf).
