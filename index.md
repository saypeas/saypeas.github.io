I'm Victoria, a senior studying economics, statistics, and political science at Stanford University. I worked on economics research at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/projects/the-hamilton-project/){:target="_blank"}, [Innovations for Poverty Action](https://poverty-action.org/financial-inclusion){:target="_blank"}, and the [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research](https://siepr.stanford.edu/california-policy-research-initiative-capri){:target="_blank"}. I also enjoy reading creative non-fiction essays. My current favorites are [Goodbye to All That](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/22211308/joan-didion-goodbye-to-all-that-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Notes of a Native Son](https://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/570f15/baldwin.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [The Courage of Turtles](https://dayonecomptwo.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/hoagland-the-courage-of-turtles.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
